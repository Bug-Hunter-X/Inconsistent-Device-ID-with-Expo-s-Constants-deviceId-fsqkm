This bug occurs when using Expo's `Constants.deviceId` to uniquely identify a user's device.  In some cases, especially when using simulators or emulators, or when the device's unique identifier changes (e.g., after a factory reset), `Constants.deviceId` might return inconsistent or unexpected values. This can lead to issues with user data persistence, analytics tracking, or other features that rely on a consistent device identifier.
